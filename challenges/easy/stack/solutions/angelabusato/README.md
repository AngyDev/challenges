# The Stack Data Structure with Elixir

### Stack data structure explanation

Stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure. The goal of a stack data structure, is to store items in such a way that the most recent item is found first. It only provides access to the top element in the stack (the most recent element).Stack is often described using the analogy of a spring-loaded stack of plates in a cafeteria. Clean plates are placed on top of the stack, pushing down any already there. When a plate is removed from the stack, the one below it pops up to become the new top plate. Stack is used.

### Stack applications
